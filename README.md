# PawAtlas – Bachelor's Thesis Project

This repository contains two versions of the same web application project:

## pawatlas-serverless

This project was made for my Bachelor Thesis.  
It outlines the steps to build a progressive web app prototype using Angular and Firebase.  
Users can create personal profiles and profiles for their companions,  
then interact with a map to add/view points of interest (e.g., vets, shelters) and hazards (e.g., toxic zones, restricted areas).  
Implemented features include interactive map use cases, authentication, and a NoSQL database.  
The project also analyzes Angular’s benefits, especially for transforming a web app into a PWA.  
Reactive programming concepts were used to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.

You can find several screenshots from when it was live in my Bachelor thesis and also below.

## pawatlas-client-server

Refactored version using a NestJS backend and a new Angular frontend adapted to a REST API.  
Same functionalities as above, with a PostgreSQL database and the possibility to add a companion.
